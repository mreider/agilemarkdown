What? You wanna manage backlogs in markdown? Are you a masochist?

Absolutely. Yes. Here's why:

1. It's easy - backlogs are directories & stories are files
2. It's flexible - any editor works
3. Everyone likes markdown
4. Technical folks can edit files in a terminal
5. Files managed in git - merge conflicts encourage conversations

## What is Agile Markdown?

1. A command line interface (CLI) for managing backlogs and stories in markdown using git
2. A framework for managing backlogs and stories, locally, using any text editor
3. A simple way to share the backlog on a web server and sync everyone's copy using git
4. A way to gather ideas (also in markdown) from different people and connect them to stories
5. A simple set of generated charts showing a backlog's velocity
6. A timeline of forecasted delivery - a.k.a. gantt charts
