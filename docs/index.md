What? You wanna manage backlogs in markdown? Are you a masochist?

Absolutely. Yes. Here's why:

1. It's easy - backlogs are directories & stories are files
2. It's flexible - any editor works
3. Everyone likes markdown
4. Technical folks can edit files in a terminal
5. Files managed in git - merge conflicts encourage conversations
