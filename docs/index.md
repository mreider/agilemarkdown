Welcome to Agile Markdown - an open source tool for managing backlogs.

## Why did we build it?

1. It's easy - backlogs are directories & stories are files
2. It's flexible - any editor works
3. Everyone likes markdown

## What is it?

1. A command line interface (CLI) for managing backlogs and stories in markdown using git
2. A framework for managing backlogs and stories, locally, using any text editor
3. A simple way to collaborate using a Google oAuth protected website
4. A way to gather ideas (also in markdown) from different people and connect them to stories
5. A simple set of generated charts showing a backlog's velocity
6. A timeline of forecasted delivery - a.k.a. gantt charts

## Who can use it?

Anyone in your organization can use Agile Markdown.

- **Engineers and technical product managers** can use Agile Markdown's command line interface (CLI) to manage backlogs, sync backlogs with other git users, and collaborate with one another. They can also set up an Agile Markdown website so that other users can participate.

- **Non-technical product managers** can use an Agile Markdown website to manage backlogs and collaborate with other users.

- **Subject matter experts and other stakeholders** can use an Agile Markdown website to suggest ideas, check on progress, and respond to comments made by other users.
